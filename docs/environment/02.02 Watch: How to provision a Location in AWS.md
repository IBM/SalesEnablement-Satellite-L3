This video shows the provisioning of an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS. The video has been edited to minimize the viewing time and does not reflect the actual provisioning time of a Satellite Location. The actual provisioning time (from clicking "Create location" to the Location being ready) will vary. When this video was created, it took approximately 25 minutes for the 6 hosts to be provisioned in AWS and configured as a Satellite Location.

Use this video to understand the talking points you can use with a client when describing the provisioning process.
